# Data Structures & Algorithms

### Stacks and Queues

[Data Structures: Stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))\n
[Data Structures: Queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Include
* gitignore
* eslint
* package.json
* gulpfile
* readme
 * Write a paragraph about your project
 * Document your methods (format them using markdown for clean readability!)
 * Write docs on your implementation and document your Big-O
* tests
  * use chai's expect and should where applicable
  * ensure that all of your codes has test coverage

## Directions
*You should have the `.push()` and `.peek()` methods of a Stack, and the `.enqueue() method of the Queue.*
* Complete the implementation of of the Stack:
  * `.push()`, `.pop()`, and `.peek()`
* Complete the implementation of of the Queue:
  * `.enqueue()` and `.dequeue()`
* Write clean test coverage for your data structures
  * ensure that you've covered any edge cases and tested thoroughly

## Bonus
* 2pts: Implement the ability to take an array of values as an argument to your Stack and Queue constructors, and create new Nodes in the data structure for each value in the array.
